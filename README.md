Airbnb Data with Cleaning and Visualization Techniques
In this project, I explored the importance of cleaning data to reveal its true value. Using a curated dataset, I analyzed New York City's Airbnb listings to uncover how Airbnb is impacting neighborhoods and reveal actionable insights. I simplify the process of data cleaning and discover the fascinating connections between Airbnb and its surroundings.
